                    <img id="hammock" src="images/hammock.jpg"><p> Well for starters... I don't have a ton of coding related things to put in this initial about me but, be prepared, great things are coming. So about me, well for starters I have way too many hobbies. Everything from building computers, to laying in hammocks, working on cars, building things out of wood, and general cat napping. But who can complain? I got into this course that I could learn and refine my computer skills. And while so far I absolutely love it, sometimes when you're staring at a code you kinda feel like a guy trying to break big rocks with bigger rocks to get small rocks to throw at other rocks that need to be knocked down. I'm honestly thinking that's half of the fun of it at this point. No matter what you learn this is like the ultimate Sudoku, except it's like an encyclopedia... that's missing half the word and half the definition. But there's something cool about finally finding the error in the code and getting things on your page to work properly. Honestly I'm a bit surprised that it took me this long to get into coding seriously. My first and only web-pages I made were in middle school dedicated to what ever dumb things kids were into at that point in life, where as by comparison my first computer had a 50mb hard drive and played Oregon Trail like a boss. But time flies and now we have petabyte hard drives and touch screens, so I'm here to learn how to code front to back. Hopefully it turns out better than Oregon Trail...</p>
